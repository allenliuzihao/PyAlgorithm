    DESCRIPTION
    PyAlgorithm is a fun open source project that provides algorithmic library for python.
    Its goal is to cover as much fundamental algorithms in computer science as possible in Python,
    and therefore provide easy to use programming tools for application developer or contestants from coding challenge.
